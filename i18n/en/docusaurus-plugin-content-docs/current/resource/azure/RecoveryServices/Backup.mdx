Azure Backup is Microsoft's cloud-based backup solution for protecting data and applications in the cloud. 
With Azure Backup, you can back up data from on-premises servers, virtual machines running in Azure, and other cloud services. 
It offers flexible backup schedules and retention policies, allowing you to customize how frequently and for how long backups are retained. 
Additionally, it provides features like incremental backups, encryption, and data compression to optimize storage usage and reduce backup times.
