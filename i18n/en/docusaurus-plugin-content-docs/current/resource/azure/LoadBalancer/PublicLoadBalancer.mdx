## Resource Overview

A Load Balancer efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across a group of backend resources or servers. 
Azure Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, serving as a single point of contact for clients. 
The Load Balancer distributes inbound traffic arriving at its front end across the backend pool instances. 
This distribution follows the configured load balancing rules and health probes. 
Backend pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances from a Virtual Machine Scale Set. 
A Public Load Balancer provides outbound connectivity for virtual machines within a virtual network by translating private IP addresses to public IP addresses. 
The Public Load Balancer is also used to distribute internet traffic to the VMs.
