## Resource Overview

A Load Balancer refers to the efficient distribution of incoming network traffic across a group of backend resources or servers. 
Azure Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, serving as a single point of contact for clients.
The Load Balancer distributes inbound traffic arriving at its front end to instances in the backend pool. 
This distribution is governed by configured load-balancing rules and health probes. 
Backend pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances from a Virtual Machine Scale Set.
A Private Load Balancer is used when only a private IP address is required at the front end. 
It is employed to distribute traffic within a virtual network. In hybrid scenarios, it is possible to access the Load Balancer's front end from an on-premises network.
