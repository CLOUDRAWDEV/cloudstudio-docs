## Resource Overview

Azure Application Insights is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft to help developers monitor and analyze live applications. 
It enables developers to detect and diagnose issues with their applications and gain real-time insights into application performance. 
By using Application Insights, developers can track metrics such as requests per second, response times, and error rates, as well as gain visibility into dependencies and external services used by the application. 
This allows for faster and more efficient problem resolution.
