## Resource Overview

Azure Application Insights is a cloud-based service from Microsoft that helps developers monitor and analyze live applications. 
This allows developers to detect and diagnose problems in an application and gain real-time insights into application performance. 
By using Application Insights, developers can track metrics such as requests per second, response times, and error rates, and gain visibility into the dependencies and external services used by the application.
This allows for faster and more efficient problem resolution.
