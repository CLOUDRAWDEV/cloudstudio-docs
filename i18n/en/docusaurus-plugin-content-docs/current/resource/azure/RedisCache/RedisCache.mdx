## Resource Overview

Azure Redis Cache is a fully managed, in-memory data store based on the open-source Redis Cache engine. 
It is offered as a service on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and is used to build highly scalable and responsive applications. 
Azure Redis Cache can be utilized to store and retrieve data such as session data, user preferences, and application state that needs to be accessed frequently and quickly. 
It supports various data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. With features like data persistence, high availability, and automatic scaling, Azure Redis Cache is widely used for building applications that require fast and reliable data access. 
It can also be integrated with other Azure services such as Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Azure Logic Apps.
