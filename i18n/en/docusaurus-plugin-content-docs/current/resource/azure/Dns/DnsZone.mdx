## Resource Overview

Azure DNS zones are a service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows you to host DNS domains and manage DNS records in the cloud. 
You can manage DNS records such as A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, and TXT, and configure DNS settings like SOA (Start of Authority), NS (Name Server), and PTR (Pointer) records.
By using Azure DNS zones, you can have a highly available and scalable DNS solution that integrates with other Azure services such as Virtual Machines, Load Balancers, and App Services. 
It can also be used with on-premises resources to provide an integrated and consistent DNS management environment.
Azure DNS zones support both public and private DNS zones. 
Public DNS zones are used to map domain names to IP addresses accessible over the internet, while private DNS zones are used to map domain names to private IP addresses accessible only within a virtual network.
