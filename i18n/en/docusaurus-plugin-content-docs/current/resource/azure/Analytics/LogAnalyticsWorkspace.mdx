## Resource Overview

Log Analytics is a tool used in the Azure Portal for editing and running log queries against data in Azure Monitor log storage. 
You can create simple queries that return sets of records and then use Log Analytics features to sort, filter, and analyze the data. 
Alternatively, you can write advanced queries to perform statistical analysis and visualize results in charts to identify specific trends. 
Whether you are handling query results interactively or using queries with other Azure Monitor features like query alerts or workbook logs, Log Analytics is used for writing and testing queries.
