## Resource Overview

An availability set is a logical group of VMs that helps Azure understand how your application is built to provide redundancy and availability.
To deliver a highly available application and meet the 99.95% Azure SLA, it is recommended to have at least two VMs in an availability set.
There is no cost for the availability set itself; you only pay for each VM instance you create.
