## Resource Overview

Azure Windows Server Virtual Machine Scale Sets are groups of virtual machines running the Windows operating system that can automatically scale up or down as needed. 
You can manually adjust the number of VMs in the scale set or define rules to automatically resize based on resource usage, such as CPU, memory requirements, or network traffic. 
Traffic is then distributed across the VM instances in the scale set by Azure's load balancer.
