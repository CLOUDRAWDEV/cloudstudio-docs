## Resource Overview

An Azure Policy set definition is a collection of one or more policy definitions grouped together for easier management and assignment. 
You can create policy sets that can be applied to multiple resource types, resource groups, or subscriptions.
Using a policy set definition allows you to apply a set of policies to a resource or resource group in a single operation, rather than applying each policy individually. 
This simplifies policy management and helps ensure that all resources comply with organizational standards and policies.
Policy set definitions can be defined in JSON format and may include parameters, metadata, and policy definitions. 
Additionally, they can reference other policy set definitions or policy definitions to create complex policies that can be applied to multiple resources and resource groups.
