## Resource Overview

Azure Policy definitions provide a way to enforce and audit governance policies. 
You can use policy definitions to create rules for resource properties, tags, or resource groups. 
For example, you might create a policy definition that requires all virtual machines to have a specific tag or restricts the creation of virtual machines in certain regions.
Once a policy definition is created, it can be assigned to an Azure scope such as a resource group or subscription. 
This ensures that the policy is enforced across all resources within that scope, and compliance reports are generated to verify that resources adhere to the governance policies.
