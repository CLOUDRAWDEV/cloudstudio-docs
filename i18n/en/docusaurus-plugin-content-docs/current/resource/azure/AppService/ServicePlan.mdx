## Resource Overview


Azure App Service is a PaaS offering that allows you to build and host web apps, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs using your chosen programming language, without needing to manage the infrastructure. 
App Service provides auto-scaling and high availability, and supports both Windows and Linux operating systems. 
It can be automatically deployed from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or Git repositories.
