## Resource Overview

Azure Route Table is a Microsoft Azure service that helps route network traffic between subnets within a Virtual Network (VNet) and across VNets. 
A route table contains a set of rules, known as routes, which define the network traffic paths to targets from subnets or VNets. 
Route tables are useful for controlling traffic flow between subnets in a virtual network and for providing custom routing paths to virtual machines. 
By defining routes in a route table, you can direct traffic to specific targets through particular network interfaces, gateways, or service endpoints.
In Azure, you can associate a route table with a subnet, and all resources in that subnet will automatically use the routes defined in the associated route table. 
Additionally, you can connect route tables to virtual network gateways to control traffic routing between virtual networks.
