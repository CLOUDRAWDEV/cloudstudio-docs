## Resource Overview

Azure Bastion is a service deployed to allow connections to virtual machines using a browser and the Azure Portal, or through the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. 
The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service provisioned within your virtual network. 
It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly through the Azure Portal via TLS. 
When connecting through Azure Bastion, you do not need a public IP address, agent, or special client software for the virtual machine.
