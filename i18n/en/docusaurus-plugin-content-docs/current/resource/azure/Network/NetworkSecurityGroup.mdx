## Resource Overview

Here’s the revised English version:

Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is a networking filter in Azure that controls access to resources within a Virtual Network (VNet). 
It acts as a firewall, allowing or denying network traffic based on a set of defined rules.
NSGs can be associated with subnets, network interfaces, or virtual machines within a VNet. 
Once associated, the NSG filters inbound and outbound traffic to and from the resource.
NSGs can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules with assigned priorities, allowing for detailed control of network traffic.
As a key component of Azure's network security, NSGs provide an additional layer of protection for virtual network resources. 
They help limit exposure to potential threats by filtering network traffic at the subnet level.
