## Resource Overview

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a networking feature provided by the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform. 
It allows you to create a logically isolated network environment in the cloud, which can be used to securely connect Azure resources, such as virtual machines, to each other, to the internet, and to on-premises networks.
With Azure Virtual Network, you can create multiple subnets and define Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources. 
Additionally, you can securely connect your virtual network to on-premises networks using Azure VPN Gateway or Azure ExpressRoute.
