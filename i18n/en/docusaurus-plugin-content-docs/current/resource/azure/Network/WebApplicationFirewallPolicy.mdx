## Resource Overview

Azure WAF (Web Application Firewall) policies are a security feature in Microsoft Azure that help protect web applications from various attacks, including XSS (cross-site scripting), SQL injection, and other known or unknown exploits. 
WAF policies are a set of rules that determine how traffic is filtered through the WAF. They allow you to define lists of allowed and blocked traffic sources and configure custom rules and exceptions for specific traffic patterns. 
WAF policies can be applied to individual web applications or to an entire application gateway.
