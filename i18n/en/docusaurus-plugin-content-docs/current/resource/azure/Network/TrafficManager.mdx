## Resource Overview

Azure Traffic Manager is a cloud-based traffic management service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows users to control and distribute incoming traffic across multiple endpoints such as Azure virtual machines, cloud services, web apps, and even on-premises endpoints. 
By using Traffic Manager, users can automatically route traffic to the best available endpoints based on various routing methods such as priority, performance, geographic location, or round-robin. 
This helps improve the availability, performance, and resilience of applications.
