## Resource Overview

ExpressRoute Circuit is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows users to create a private connection between their on-premises infrastructure and Azure data centers. 
Since traffic is routed through a private connection rather than the public internet, it offers a more secure and reliable connection compared to typical internet-based connections.
ExpressRoute Circuit essentially provides a dedicated private network connection, enabling access to Azure services like virtual machines, storage, and databases as if they were part of the user's own on-premises infrastructure. 
This allows organizations to extend their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud and access Azure services without exposing their network to the public internet.
