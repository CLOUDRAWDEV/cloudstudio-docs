## Resource Overview

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that manages traffic for web applications. 
Unlike traditional load balancers, which operate at the transport layer (OSI Layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port to destination IP address and port, Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of HTTP requests, such as URI paths or host headers. 
For example, it can route traffic based on the incoming URL. 
If the incoming URL contains /images, it can route the traffic to a specific set of servers (also known as a pool) configured for images. 
Conversely, if the URL contains /video, the traffic is routed to a different pool optimized for video.
