## Resource Overview

Azure DDoS Protection is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that helps protect Azure resources from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. 
Azure DDoS Protection offers three protection tiers: Basic, Standard, and Premium. 
The Basic tier provides protection against common network layer attacks, while the Standard and Premium tiers offer additional protection against more sophisticated application layer attacks. 
The Azure DDoS Protection plan is a pricing model where customers pay for the DDoS Protection service based on the number of protected public IP addresses in their Azure subscription. 
This plan offers a cost-effective way for customers to protect their Azure resources from DDoS attacks without incurring additional expenses for the protection service.
