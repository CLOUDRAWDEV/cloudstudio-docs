## Resource Overview

Azure Private Endpoint is a feature of Azure that allows you to access Azure services (such as Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Cosmos DB) privately within a virtual network. 
This enables secure access to these services through a private endpoint in the virtual network, rather than over the public internet.
Using Azure Private Endpoint, the accessed service is mapped to a private IP address within the virtual network, and traffic between the virtual network and the service is routed over a private link. 
This ensures that traffic remains within the boundaries of the virtual network and is not exposed to the public internet.
