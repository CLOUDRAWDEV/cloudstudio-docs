## Resource Overview

The Azure Virtual Network Gateway is a Microsoft Azure service that allows for secure cross-premises connections between an Azure virtual network and on-premises infrastructure or other Azure virtual networks. 
It acts as a bridge between on-premises infrastructure and Azure virtual networks, enabling the extension of data centers to the cloud and creating hybrid solutions.
Azure Virtual Network Gateway provides two types of VPN connections: site-to-site VPN and point-to-site VPN. 
Site-to-site VPN is used to connect on-premises networks to an Azure virtual network, while point-to-site VPN is used to connect individual computers to an Azure virtual network.
Azure Virtual Network Gateway also supports various routing types, including BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), static routing, and dynamic routing. 
Additionally, it offers features such as high availability, active-active configuration, and support for multiple virtual network gateways.
