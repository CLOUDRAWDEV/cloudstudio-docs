## Resource Overview

In Microsoft Azure, a subnet is an IP address range within a VNet (virtual network). 
It represents a logical division of the IP network that allows for network traffic segmentation and management of network resources. 
A subnet is a smaller network within a larger network and is used to isolate traffic between different parts of a virtual network. 
Each subnet in Azure can have its own NSG (Network Security Group), which helps to create security boundaries for the resources within that subnet.
