## Resource Overview

Azure NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway is a managed networking service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables resources within a Virtual Network (VNet) to access the internet while keeping their source IP addresses hidden. 
By using Azure NAT Gateway, you can provide internet connectivity to resources within a VNet without exposing their private IP addresses to the internet. 
This helps enhance security by preventing direct access to the resources from the internet. 
Additionally, it can help reduce the number of public IP addresses required for accessing resources within the VNet.
