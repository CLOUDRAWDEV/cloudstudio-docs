## Resource Overview

SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. 
With Amazon RDS for SQL Server, you can easily set up, operate, and scale SQL Server deployments in the cloud. 
Amazon RDS allows you to deploy various versions of SQL Server, including Express, Web, Standard, and Enterprise editions (2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019), with cost-effective and scalable computing power in just a few minutes. Additionally, Amazon RDS handles time-consuming database management tasks such as provisioning, backups, software patching, monitoring, and hardware scaling, allowing you to focus solely on application development.
