## Resource Overview

The AWS ElastiCache Cluster is a cloud-based in-memory data store that provides a fast and scalable caching solution. 
ElastiCache Clusters can run using either the Redis or Memcached engine in cluster mode or single-node mode. 
They are used to enhance application performance by enabling faster data retrieval and processing. 
ElastiCache Clusters offer features such as automated backups, recovery, scaling, and monitoring, ensuring that users can securely store and manage their data with confidence.
