## Resource Overview

A security group controls the traffic that can reach and leave the associated resources. 
For instance, when a security group is attached to an EC2 instance, it manages the inbound and outbound traffic to and from that instance. 
Security groups can only be associated with resources within the VPC where the security group was created.
When a VPC is created, it comes with a default security group. 
Additional security groups can be created for each VPC.
There is no additional charge for using security groups.
