## Resource Overview

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a dedicated virtual network for your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud. 
You can launch AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, within your VPC.
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables traffic to route between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. 
Instances in the VPCs can communicate with each other as if they were within the same network. 
You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs or between a VPC in another AWS account. 
VPCs can be in different regions, which is referred to as inter-region VPC peering.
