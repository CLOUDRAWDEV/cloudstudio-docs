## Resource Overview

An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scalable, highly available, and redundant VPC component that enables communication between a VPC and the internet. 
It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, ensuring there are no availability risks or bandwidth constraints for network traffic.
When resources have public IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, an Internet Gateway allows resources in a public subnet (e.g., EC2 instances) to connect to the internet. Similarly, resources on the internet can initiate connections to resources in the subnet using public IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. 
For example, you can use an Internet Gateway to connect from your local computer to an EC2 instance on AWS.
The Internet Gateway provides targets for internet-routable traffic in the VPC routing table. For IPv4 communication, the Internet Gateway performs Network Address Translation (NAT). For IPv6 communication, since IPv6 addresses are public, NAT is not required.
