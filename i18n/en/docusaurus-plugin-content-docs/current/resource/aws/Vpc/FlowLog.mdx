## Resource Overview

VPC Flow Logs provide the ability to collect information about IP traffic transmitted and received on network interfaces within a VPC. 
Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. 
Once flow logs are created, you can retrieve and view the flow log records from the configured log group, bucket, or delivery stream.
