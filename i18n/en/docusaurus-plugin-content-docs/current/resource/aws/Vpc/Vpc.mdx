## Resource Overview

Using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you have full control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security. 
Start by setting up a VPC using the AWS Management Console. Next, add resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances to your VPC. 
Finally, define how your VPC communicates within your account, availability zones, or AWS regions. In the example below, network traffic is shared between two VPCs within each region.
