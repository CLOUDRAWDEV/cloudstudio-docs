## Resource Overview

A network access control list (ACL) controls whether specific inbound or outbound traffic is allowed or denied at the subnet level. 
You can use the default network ACL for your VPC or create a custom network ACL with rules similar to those of security groups to add an additional layer of security to your VPC. 
There are no additional charges for using network ACLs.
