## Resource Overview

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances. It also monitors the health of registered targets and routes traffic only to targets that are in good health. 
Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, and Classic Load Balancer.
