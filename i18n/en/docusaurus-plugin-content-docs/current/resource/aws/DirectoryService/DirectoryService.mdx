## Resource Overview

AWS Directory Service provides several ways to use Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with other AWS services. 
Directories store information about users, groups, and devices, and administrators use this information to manage access to data and resources. 
AWS Directory Service offers a range of directory options for customers who want to use existing Microsoft AD or LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) applications in the cloud. 
It also provides the same options for developers who need a directory to manage users, groups, devices, and access permissions.
