## Resource Overview

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. 
With Amazon EC2, you can develop and deploy applications faster without the need for upfront hardware investments. 
Amazon EC2 allows you to create as many virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. 
It also enables you to handle changes in requirements or usage spikes by scaling up or down, reducing the need for traffic forecasting.
