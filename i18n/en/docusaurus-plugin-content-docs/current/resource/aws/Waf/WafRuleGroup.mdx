## Resource Overview

An AWS WAF Rule Group is a collection of rules used by the Web Application Firewall. 
By using Rule Groups, you can bundle multiple rules together to apply them to your web application, enhancing reusability and management efficiency. 
Rule Groups control critical aspects of web application security and perform actions such as allowing, blocking, or counting requests.
