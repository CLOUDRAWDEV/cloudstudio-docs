## Resource Overview

AWS Service Catalog allows IT administrators to create and manage portfolios consisting of approved products and deploy them to end users. 
End users can access the products they need through a personalized portal. 
Typical products include servers, databases, websites, or applications deployed using AWS resources (e.g., Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS databases). By controlling which users can access specific products, organizations can enforce business standards and compliance, manage the product lifecycle, and enable users to confidently discover and launch products.
