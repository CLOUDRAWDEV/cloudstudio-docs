## Resource Overview

AWS CloudTrail allows you to monitor your AWS deployment in the cloud by retrieving a history of AWS API calls made through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDK, command-line tools, and higher-level AWS services. 
It also provides insights into which users and accounts called AWS APIs for CloudTrail-supported services, the source IP addresses of those calls, and the times when the calls occurred. 
You can integrate CloudTrail with your applications using APIs, automate the creation of trails for your organization, check trail status, and control how administrators enable and disable CloudTrail logging.
