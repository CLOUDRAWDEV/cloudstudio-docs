## Resource Overview

AWS CloudWatch Metrics are name-value pairs that represent measurements collected from monitored resources. 
For example, metrics such as CPU utilization, network input, and output can be collected from EC2 instances. 
These metrics are stored as CloudWatch Metrics and are used for dashboards, alerts, and analysis. 
Additionally, you can create custom metrics to monitor data collected from your applications and services. 
CloudWatch Metrics are integrated with various services provided by AWS.
