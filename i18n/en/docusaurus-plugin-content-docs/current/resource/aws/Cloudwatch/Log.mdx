## Resource Overview

Here is the revised version in English:

Amazon CloudWatch Logs allows you to monitor, store, and access system, application, and custom log files from sources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources. 
CloudWatch Logs centralizes logs from all systems, applications, and AWS services in a highly scalable single service. 
You can then easily view the logs, search for specific error codes or patterns, filter based on specific fields, or securely store them for future analysis. 
With CloudWatch Logs, you can view all logs as a consistent, time-ordered stream of events regardless of the source, query and sort based on different dimensions, group by specific fields, create custom calculations with a powerful query language, and visualize log data.
