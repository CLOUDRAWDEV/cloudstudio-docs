## Create and register Credential {#create-credential}



To register credential in Cloud Studio, you need to create credential on each CSP (Cloud Service Provider) page. 
credential registration can be done either on the `main page` or the `canvas page`. 
The reason for pre-registering credential is that they are required later when deploying canvases or importing existing infrastructure.

### Register NCloud Credential



To deploy to NAVER Cloud Platform using Cloud Studio, you need an API authentication key from NAVER Cloud Platform: the `Access Key` and `Secret Key`. 
These API authentication keys are tools used to verify whether the user making the API call has the necessary permissions.



<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={registration06} alt="이미지" />
</div>



<br />



1. Enter your `Credential`.
2. Sign up on the [NAVER Cloud Platform portal](https://www.ncloud.com/) to generate an authentication key.



:::tip



For instructions on how to sign up for NAVER Cloud Platform, please refer to [here](https://guide.ncloud-docs.com/docs/userguide-userguideaccount-2).


:::



<br />



3. On the [NCP site](https://www.ncloud.com/product/applicationService/sens), click `Apply for Use`. 
Note that you must register a `payment method` to receive the authentication key.


<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={registration08} alt="이미지" />
</div>



<br />



4. Go to `Portal > My Page > Account Management > Authentication Key Management`.
5. If no authentication key is available, click the `Create New API Authentication Key` button.



<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={registration09} alt="이미지" />
</div>



<br />



6. Copy the `Access Key ID` and paste it into Cloud Studio.
7. Generate the `Secret Key` and paste it into Cloud Studio.



<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={registration10} alt="이미지" />
</div>



<br />



:::tip



It is recommended to issue API authentication keys from a sub-account rather than a main account with full permissions, and to periodically replace the keys to guard against potential leaks. 
If you are not using the API authentication key or suspect it may have been compromised, it is also advisable to `disable or delete the key` for security purposes. 
After generating a new API authentication key, you should `apply the updated API key` to continue using the services seamlessly.
