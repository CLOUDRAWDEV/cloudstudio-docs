Security diagnosis is a feature that examines the cloud infrastructure drawn on
the canvas for potential security issues before final export. It helps users
identify human errors and vulnerabilities that may pose security risks.

To perform a security diagnosis, please follow the steps below.

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={security01} width="800px" alt="이미지" />
</div>

<br />

1. `Save` the canvas.
2. Click on `Tools > Vulnerability Diagnosis`.
3. Check the `Diagnosis Score Results` in the detailed results.
4. Click `View Details` to examine the resources associated with each stage.
5. To modify the infrastructure, locate services marked as `Risky` or `High on the right side.
6. If a service is found, click the `Arrow Icon` to view resolution suggestions. `Current Code` shows the existing canvas code,
   while `Recommended Code` displays code with recommended security improvements.
7. Close the security diagnosis window and make the necessary adjustments on the canvas.

### Security Threat Levels

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={security02} width="500px" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br />

Security threat levels are categorized into five stages: `Critical, Warning, Moderate, Low, and Good`.
The number next to each stage represents the number of resources corresponding to that level. For example,
if the Critical level shows a number 1, it means there is 1 resource with a critical security issue in the current canvas.

While it's advisable to address resources in the Critical and High categories, it is not mandatory.
To view the resources associated with each stage, click View Details.

| Security Threat Level | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical              | The security status is highly vulnerable. It's recommended to revise the code if it's a critical infrastructure component. |
| Warning               | The security status is weak. It's advisable to update the code if it's an important infrastructure component.              |
| Moderate              | The security status is average.                                                                                            |
| Low                   | The security status is good.                                                                                               |
| Good                  | The security status is safe. It is acceptable to proceed with deployment.                                                  |
