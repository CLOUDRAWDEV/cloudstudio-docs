CloudStudio goes beyond merely providing a visual infrastructure architecture by offering functionality to deploy the infrastructure drawn on the canvas to a CSP.

<br /> This allows users to easily build cloud infrastructure.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Deployment Review {#deploy-test}

This is the stage where the syntax errors and configurations of IaC are virtually validated to ensure correctness.
The actual deployment to a CSP does not occur at this stage.

1. To perform a deployment test, click on `Management > Deploy Validation Check`.

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={deploy03} width="200px" alt="배포이미지" />
</div>

<br />

2. From the left menu, click the "Run Deploy Validation Check" button.
3. Select `Credentials`.
4. Click the `Run Deploy Validation Check` button.

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={deploy02} alt="Deployment Image" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Before proceeding with the deployment test, you must register credentials as a prerequisite. For information on how to register credentials, please refer to [here](/docs/credential/createCredential).

## Deployment History {#deploy-history}

Deployment `history shows the history of infrastructure that has been actually deployed`. You can check the `current deployment status` and `recent deployment history`.

1. To view the deployment history, click on `Deploy` > `Deploy History`.

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={deploy01} width="500px" alt="Deployment Image" />
</div>

<br />

2. Review the recent deployment history. To delete a history entry, select the desired entry and click the `Delete` button.
