Cloud Studio provides functionality for `collaborative work` by allowing you to add members to projects. 
To collaborate, you first need to create a project. 
For instructions on creating a project, please refer to [this guide](/docs/start/create-project). 
The member who creates the project will have `master` permissions and can share the workspace and modify 
the project with invited members.



## Adding and Removing Members for Collaboration

### Adding Members

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={collaboration02} width="800px" alt="image" />
</div>

<br />

1. Click on the project you want to collaborate on.
2. Click the user icon.
3. When the project members modal appears, search for the user ID of the member you want to add to the project.
4. After finding the user, assign permissions and click the Add to List button. (You can add multiple members.)
5. Once you have added all desired members, click the Add Members button.
6. Click Close. (Once members are added, they are automatically invited to the project. An invitation email will be sent to the invited members.)

<br />

### Removing Members

### Project Permissions

| Project Permissions | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| master        | The master is the person who created the project and can perform all actions such as inviting members and sharing the project.                     |
| admin         | An admin is someone who has been given access to the canvas but cannot delete or manage the project. They can edit, save, and review the canvas.|
| editor        |An editor is someone who has been given access to the canvas but cannot delete or manage the project. They can edit, save, and review the canvas.|
| viewer        | A viewer is someone who has been given access to the canvas but cannot delete or manage the project. They can only view the canvas and cannot make edits.           |

## Collaborating

1. When the master adds members to the project, an invitation email (to the user’s registered email) will be sent, and the `shared project` will appear in the Shared Folders section within Cloud Studio.
2. To collaborate, click on the shared project and then click the `Edit Project` button.
3. You can now freely edit the canvas with your team members.

<br />

### Collaborating

When the master adds members to the project, an invitation email (to the user’s registered email) will be sent, 
and the shared project will appear in the Shared Folders section within Cloud Studio.
To collaborate, click on the shared project and then click the Edit Project button.
You can now freely edit the canvas with your team members.

<p />

Members without control permissions on the canvas can send a <highlight color="#206FD6">Request Control</highlight> 
to the current controller. If the request is accepted, they will gain control of the canvas.

<admonition>
    <p>
         However, the master can take control immediately without needing the other party's consent when requesting control.
    </p>
</admonition>

<p />

Canvas control permissions are automatically transferred to the remaining users when the master leaves the project, 
following the order of `master → admin → editor` (viewers are excluded as they do not have editing rights).

<br />

To transfer canvas control, `follow the steps` below:

`Right-click` on the profile of the member to whom you want to transfer control.
Click Transfer Control.

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={collaboration01} alt="Control Transfer Image" />
</div>
