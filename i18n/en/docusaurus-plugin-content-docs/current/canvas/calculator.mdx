In CloudStudio, we provide a cost estimation feature that allows you to predict infrastructure expenses before deployment.
With this feature, you can easily `create infrastructure cost estimates and generate quotations`.

<div className={styles.imgWrap}>
    <img src={billing01} width="800px" alt="image" />
</div>

1. Click the `Calculator icon` on the left side of the canvas or select `Tools - Cost Calculation` from the top menu.
2. You can view the infrastructure costs in KRW, USD, and JPY.
