When exporting files from Cloud Studio, you can obtain three different file formats:

## Formats
- PNG file
- Three TF files (main, output, variables)
- State file (managed infrastructure)
- nodes.json file

### 1. architecture.png File

### 2. TF Files
Users will receive three TF files:

```main.tf```: This Terraform file provides the framework of the created infrastructure.
```output.tf```: This Terraform file provides information related to the infrastructure after deployment.
```variables.tf```: This Terraform file lists the variables used.

### 3. terraform.state File
A Terraform file that manages the state of the infrastructure after deployment. (Not provided before deployment.)

### 4. nodes.json File
