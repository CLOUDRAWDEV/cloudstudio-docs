                <h4>
                    User personal information is, in principle, destroyed without delay once the purpose of collection and use has been achieved.

                    1. Destruction Procedure
                    <br />
                    Information entered by the user for membership registration or other purposes is moved to a separate database (in the case of paper documents, to a separate filing cabinet) once the purpose has been achieved. This information is stored for a certain period for information protection reasons according to internal policies and other relevant laws before being destroyed. Such personal information will not be used for any purpose other than that for which it was retained unless required by law.

                    <br />
                    2. Destruction Method
                    <br />
                    Printed personal information is destroyed by shredding or incineration.
                    <br />
                    Personal information stored in electronic file formats is deleted using technical methods that prevent the restoration of records.
